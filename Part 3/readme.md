# Building an arbitrage bot: Finding arbitrage opportunities (article 3/n)

This folder contains a working script corresponding to the code in the article at [https://medium.com/@emileamajar/building-an-arbitrage-bot-finding-arbitrage-opportunities-1ea3c5e0b8ca](https://medium.com/@emileamajar/building-an-arbitrage-bot-finding-arbitrage-opportunities-1ea3c5e0b8ca).

In order to run, you need to create a file called `infura_nodes.txt` in the same folder as the script, and add your Infura nodes to it, one per line. You can get Infura nodes for free by signing up at [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/).
The code is best run in a Jupyter notebook, but you can also run it as a regular Python script.
